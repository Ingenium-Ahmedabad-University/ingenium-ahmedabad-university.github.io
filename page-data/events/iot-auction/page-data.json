In the first part of the event, teams will bid for components, as well as for the problem statement that they want. There will be open as well as close bids. The rules of the auction will be conveyed at the time of the event. In the second part, the teams will have to build the prototype of a model/system using the components they have bought using the online platform Tinkercad. Judging will be done on the basis of clarity of idea and the usage of components.","speakerName":null,"designation":null,"speakerImg":null,"formLink":"https://forms.gle/XaX8YonmRvc5Uhpy5","type":"competition"}},"pageContext":{"event":"iot-auction"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2468095761"]}
