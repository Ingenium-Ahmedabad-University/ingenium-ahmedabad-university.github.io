You are absolutely  going to make errors, at least if you’re a human and not a robot. Users don’t see errors by default in the browser. So, if something goes wrong in the script, we won’t see what’s broken and can’t fix it. To figure out what the errors are and get a lot of other useful information about scripts, “Developer tools” have been embedded in browsers.
