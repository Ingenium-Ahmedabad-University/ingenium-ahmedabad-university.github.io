FEA uses mathematical models to understand and quantify the effects of real-world conditions on a part or assembly. These simulations, which are conducted via specialised software, allow engineers to locate potential problems in a design, including areas of tension and weak spots.","speakers":[{"speakerName":"Dr. Srinivas Sir","designation":",Associate Director, Space infrastructure, ISRO HQ, Bangalore.","speakerImg":"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/10/05/22/37/blank-profile-picture-973460_640.png"}],"formLink":"https://forms.gle/MXFNLFJ7hNmjEJsG6","type":"workshop"}},"pageContext":{"event":"space-talk"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2468095761"]}
