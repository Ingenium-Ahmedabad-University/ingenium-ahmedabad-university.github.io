    "description": "Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. In this session we would learn about Docker and applications.",

    "description": "Code is prone to errors. You are absolutely  going to make errors, at least if you’re a human and not a robot. Users don’t see errors by default in the browser. So, if something goes wrong in the script, we won’t see what’s broken and can’t fix it. To figure out what the errors are and get a lot of other useful information about scripts, “Developer tools” have been embedded in browsers. The Developer Console is an integrated development environment with a collection of tools you can use to create, debug, and test applications. Ingenium presents to you a workshop on Developer Console.",

    "description": "UI design and UX design are two of the most often confused and conflated terms in web and app design. The user interface(UI) is the graphical layout of an application. It consists of the buttons users click on, the text they read, the images, sliders, text entry fields and all the rest of the items the user interacts with. User experience(UX) of the application is determined by how users interact with it. UI designers are tasked with deciding how the UI will look, IX designers are in charge of determining how the UI operates. The session will include the basics of UI/UX and how are these related.",
