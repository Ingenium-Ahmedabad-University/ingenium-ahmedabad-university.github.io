A failure of a single rotating machinery leads to huge economic losses because of higher production downtimes and increased maintenance activities. In addition, the chances of human casualties are tremendously increased. The present seminar focuses on discussing efficacious condition-monitoring tools and solutions with an aim to eradicate the catastrophic failures in roto-mechanical equipment before it occurs and thus prevent the related damaging consequences.","speakers":[{"speakerName":"Prof. Akhand Rai","designation":"Assistant Professor @ Ahmedabad University","speakerImg":"https://ahduni.edu.in/site/assets/files/6906/untitled_design_4.240x309.png"}],"formLink":"https://forms.gle/EnosGx9qQPjUhtnE6","type":"workshop"}},"pageContext":{"event":"fault-daignosis"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2468095761"]}
